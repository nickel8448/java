/**
 * Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/
 *
 * <p>Example:
 *
 * <p>X X X X X O O X X X O X X O X X After running your function, the board should be:
 *
 * <p>X X X X X X X X X X X X X O X X Explanation:
 *
 * <p>Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the
 * board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O'
 * on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells
 * connected horizontally or vertically.
 *
 * <p>Approach: 1) Run DFS on 'O' in the first column and the last column 2) Run DFS on 'O' in the
 * first row and the last row 3) Mark all the 'O' from DFS as '*' 4) Loop through the entire matrix
 * and if 'O' is encountered, convert it to 'X' 5) If '*' is encountered in matrix convert it to 'O'
 *
 * <p>Complexity - O(3MN) -> O(MN) Explanation - Going through the matrix twice with DFS and the
 * last time to change the matrix

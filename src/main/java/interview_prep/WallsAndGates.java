/**
 * Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/walls-and-gates/
 *
 * <p>Example:
 *
 * <p><INF -1 0 INF INF INF INF -1 INF -1 INF -1 0 -1 INF INF
 *
 * <p>Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the
 * board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O'
 * on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells
 * connected horizontally or vertically.
 *
 * <p>Approach: Start by looping through the Matrix and getting all the nodes with 0 1) Start BFS if
 * a 0 is found Adding a sentinel node so that I know that one part of BFS has finished 2) Each
 * level of BFS will be a plus one 3) The new value will be added and if the value is not inifite,
 * take the lesser of the current and the new value
 *
 * <p>Complexity - O(mn)
